	<h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>
	  In order to get the most our of this class, it is useful to
	  read up on the topic of the lectures <em>before</em> class
	  as well as to revisit the material <em>after</em> the lecture.
	  Doing this will be part of the requirements of this class.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <em>Note:</em>: this is not a request for
	  you to submit whatever notes you are taking
	  <em>in</em> class for yourself.  Instead, 
	  the format will be as described here:
	</p>
	<p>
	  <em>Prior</em> to each class, please review the linked reading
	  material and any other related documents you might find
	  on your own.  Note which exercises your completed.
	  Make a note of any concepts or topics that
	  are unclear to you, or for which you'd like to see
	  clarification or further information.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <em>After</em> each class, please revisit your notes and
	  assess your understanding.  Did your questions get answered?
	  Did new ones arise?  What did you learn?  Was there anything
	  of particular interest that you came across?  Share your
	  questions or findings on the class mailing list!
	</p>
	<p>

	<h3>File format and submission</h3> 
	<p>
	  Create a <a href="git.html">git</a> repository for your class notes.
	  In it, create a <em>plain ascii text file</em> for each lecture.
	  Update this file twice: once <em>before</em> the class, and
	  once <em>after</em> the class.  Make sure to <tt>git commit</tt>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The following is an illustration what your
	  notes for the first class might look like:
	  <blockquote><pre>
Lecture 01
==========

Before class:
-------------
I carefully read the course website and syllabus.
I read chapters 01 and 02 in Stevens.

I wrote a small hello-world program, debugged the
'welcome.c' program, and set up my VM with the
suitable compiler flags and aliases.

I came across this interesting article:
https://some.website.you.found/something-relevant.html

Open questions:
What's the difference between Linux and NetBSD? Aren't
both Unix?

Why are there different sections for the manual pages?
What does the "(1)" in "ls(1)" mean?

After class:
------------
Important take-away:
- always use the right compiler flags ('-Wall -Wextra -Werror')
- despite being "unix-like", Linux and NetBSD are
  different OS with different philosophies and licenses
- I still need to grok the pipeline example from class

	<p>
	  At the end of the semester, <tt>tar</tt> up the directory,
	  including the <tt>.git</tt> files and submit the resulting
	  file via email to <a href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu?subject=[CS631] class notes">jschauma@stevens.edu</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The due dates for the course notes to be
	submitted is 2020-12-14 18:00.

	<p>
	 The folllowing is an example sequence of commands to create a valid
	 submission:
<pre>
mkdir $USER-notes
cd $USER-notes
git init
vi 01.txt
git add 01.txt
git commit .
vi 02.txt
git add 02.txt
git commit .
...
cd ..
tar cf $USER-notes.tar $USER-notes
