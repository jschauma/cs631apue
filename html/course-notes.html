	<h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>
	  In order to get the most our of this class, it is useful to
	  read up on the topic of the lectures <em>before</em> class
	  as well as to revisit the material <em>after</em> the lecture.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Doing this will be part of the requirements of this class.
	  The format will be the course notes described here:
	</p>
	<p>
	  <em>Prior</em> to each class, please review the linked reading
	  material and any other related documents you might find
	  on your own.  Make a note of any concepts or topics that
	  are unclear to you, or for which you'd like to see
	  clarification or further information.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <em>After</em> each class, please revisit your notes and
	  assess your understanding.  Did your questions get answered?
	  Did new ones arise?  What did you learn?  Was there anything
	  of particular interest that you came across?  Share your
	  questions or findings on the class mailing list!
	</p>
	<p>

	<h3>File format and submission</h3> 
	<p>
	  Create a <a href="git.html">git</a> repository for your class notes.
	  In it, create a <em>plain ascii text file</em> for each lecture.
	  Update this file twice: once <em>before</em> the class, and
	  once <em>after</em> the class.  Make sure to <tt>git commit</tt>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  At the end of the semester, <tt>tar</tt> up the directory,
	  including the <tt>.git</tt> files and submit the resulting
	  file via email to <a href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu?subject=[CS631] class notes">jschauma@stevens.edu</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	 The folllowing is an example sequence of commands to create a valid
	 submission:
<pre>
mkdir $USER-notes
cd $USER-notes
git init
vi 01.txt
git commit .
vi 02.txt
git commit .
...
cd ..
tar cf $USER-notes.tar $USER-notes
