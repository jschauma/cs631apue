        <H3>Intro</H3>

        <H4>Summary</H4>
	<p>
	One of the most important pre-requisites for this class -- the
	ability to work in a Unix-like environment -- cannot easily be
	measured by students having completed a given previous class.
	</p>

	<p>
	To ensure that students are able to perform even the most basic of
	tasks required to follow the course in the required environment,
	you are asked to run the script <a
	href="cs631-intro.sh">cs631-intro.sh</a> <em>on
	<tt>linux-lab.cs.stevens.edu</tt></em>.
	</p>

	<p>
	That is:
	<ul>
	<li>log in on <tt>linux-lab.cs.stevens.edu</tt></li>
	<li>fetch the file <a href="cs631-intro.sh">http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~jschauma/631/cs631-intro.sh</a></li>
	<li>run the script</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	The due date for this assignment is 2014-09-15 16:00.
	(You do not need to submit anything -- the script will do
	everything necessary on your behalf.)
	</p>
