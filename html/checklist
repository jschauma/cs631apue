For each assignment, copy this file into your homework
submission directory and answer all questions.

Did I write all the code myself?
   - Don't copy and paste code from the internet, your
     classmates, sample solutions, or anywhere else.

Does my code follow the style guide?
   - Code is communication.  Make sure your code is
     readable, well-structured, properly indented,
     with sensibily named variables and functions.


Does my code compile without warnings or errors on a
NetBSD 8.x system?
  - Always use *at least* 'cc -Wall -Werror -Wextra',
    possibly
    'cc -ansi -g -Wall -Werror -Wextra -Wformat=2 -Wjump-misses-init -Wlogical-op -Wpedantic -Wshadow'.


Did I provide a Makefile?
  - 'make' should use the above CFLAGS and produce an
    executable


Did I provide a README to explain any problems or
issues I encountered?
  - Make sure that your text is well-formatted, plain
    ASCII in proper English.  Use a spell checker.


Did I check the return value of all function calls?
  - Yes, that does include malloc(3).


Did I send error messages to stderr?


Did I use only meaningful and necessary comments?
  - Your comments should explain the 'why', not the
    'what'.


Does my program return zero on success, non-zero otherwise?


Did I make sure that my .h files only include function
forward declarations, macros, etc., no function
implementations or other code?
