        <H3>HW#1: code reading</H3>

        <H4>Summary</H4>
	<p>The objective of this assignment is for you to get used to
	read (and understand!) code.  To this end, please take a look at
	the <a href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/bin/">NetBSD
	source code for programs installed under /bin</a>, pick two
	programs of your liking and inspect the code.  Then, read the
	corresponding code of the same programs in <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/">Linux</a>
	or <strike>Open Solaris</strike> <a href="https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate/tree/master/usr/src">Illumos</a>.
	Compare the different implementations.  What do they have in
	common? What makes them different?</p>
	<h4>Deliverables and Due Date</H4>
	<p>You will submit a single <a href="text">plain text file</a> created with a unix
	text editor on a unix system called "HW1-&lt;username&gt;" (where
	"&lt;username&gt;" is your Stevens username).  In
	that file write down (<em>in proper English, spell-checked and with
	valid grammar</em>):
	<ul>
	<li>which editor you used to create the document</li>
	<li>which programs you compared</li>
	<li>how/why you chose them</li>
	<li>how you retrieved the source code to the programs in question</li>
	<li>what you have found out about the implementations</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	Note: we are not looking for a line-by-line comparison stating
	that one file has 30 lines of comments while another has 32.
	Focus on how the different implementations solved the same
	problem.  If there are notable differences, comment on what the
	reasons for the differences might be.
	</p>
	<p>
	The due date for this assignment is 2016-09-06 16:00.  Please
	attach the file to an email sent from your <tt>@stevens.edu</tt>
	email address to <a
	href="mailto:pmurray1@stevens.edu?subject=[CS631] HW1">pmurray1@stevens.edu</a>
	with a subject of "[CS631] HW1".
