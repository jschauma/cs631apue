Hello, and welcome to CS631 Advanced Programming in
the Unix Environment!

Don't panic - I'm from the internet, and I'm here to
help!  My name is Jan Schaumann, and I've been an
adjunct professor at Stevens Institute of Technology
since around 2005, teaching this class as well as
CS615 System Administration.

Besides that, I work as a principal infrastructure
security architect at Verizon Media.

You can reach me at via email at jschauma@stevens.edu
and the course website is located at the link shown on
the slide here.

Despite having taught this class for going on 15 years
now, this is the first time we are holding it entirely
online, and so you are spared the very long, late
Monday night lectures - good for you!

Instead, we are going to break the lectures into
smaller segments for you to consume asynchronously and
at your own time, and instead use the scheduled class
time for interactive discussions and for me to help
you with any questions or problems you have.

This online lecture summarizes the class; we discuss
what we will cover, how we will work, what the
syllabus looks like, and what resources you should
bookmark.

In our second part, we will then review the history of
the UNIX operating system and perform a whirlwind tour
of the Unix programming environment and some of the
features of the C programming language.

As this is the first time we are flipping the
classroom and moving all content online, I will rely
on your feedback throughout the semester to help you
get the most out of this class, so please do not be
shy in letting me know what you think.  Ok?

With that, if you are still with me and haven't
switched over to your Facebook tab, let's begin...


----

Ok, so this class is called "Advanced Programming in
the UNIX Environment".

Each of those words is aptly picked, and it is
important to note what this class is _not_.

Specifically, this class is _not_ an introduction to
using Unix.  All students are expected to be
comfortable using a Unix-like operating system from
the command-line exclusively.  I assume that you are
able to use a common Unix text editor, know how to
find, search, and manage files, how to use the shell
and the various common tools, how to compile your code
and run your program.

If you are not familiar with Unix systems or are not
comfortable using the command-line interface, then
this class will be _very_ challenging for you.


Secondly, this class is not an introductory
programming class.  That is, you are expected to have
written sizeable programs and to be familiar with most
common paradigms and the practical efforts involved
in writing and debugging code.


Finally, in this class we will be using the C
programming language, and you are expected to be
familiar with it.  Please do note the difference
between C and C++.

As we will see in the second segment of our Week I
lectures, the C programming language and the Unix
operating systems are deeply intertwined; in this
class, we will only write plain old C.


So in a nutshell, if what you see here on the screen
in the terminal looks in _any_ way foreign or strange
to you, then this class is not for you.

Ok, having gotten that out of the way, and now being
on the same page about what this class is _not_, let's
talk about what it _is_, what specifically we're doing
here:

---

As we are talking about Advanced Programming in the
UNIX Environment, let us quickly take a look at what
this environment looks like.

As you know, the system provides a number of standard
tools in the '/bin' directory.  By the end of this
class, you should be able to implement any one of
these tools.  You should be able to look at the manual
page for a given tool and from there determine how to
write the code to provide the given functionality, to
be aware of some of the edge cases and hidden
requirements that you might encounter and so on.

In fact, by the end of week 1, we'll already have
looked at how to implement -- albeit from the most
basic level -- an interactive shell, the 'ls' command,
as well as the 'cat' utility.

Take a look at the commands you find in /bin -- think
about what they do, and how you would implement them.
Can you jot down the pseudo-code for three or four of
them?

If you are not familiar with any of the commands you
see there, take note and look them up later on.
Remember that your system comes with detailed manual
pages for each of the provided commands.

---

But this class goes beyond just the command-line
utilities we use day to day, as useful and interesting
as that is.

In addition, we will be looking at interprocess
communications and even some network programming in a
client/server model.

What you see here are most of the network library
functions needed to implement communications across
the internet between hosts, to listen on a socket, to
accept connections, to send and receive data.

Note that all of these functions are operating on an
integer file desriptor, thereby providing a simple,
flexible, and consistent API.  We'll talk more about
this in future lectures.

--

So what are doing in this class?  Obviously we'll be
performing some programming in the Unix environment,
but as so often in academia, the outcomes and lessons
of a class go beyond just the practical tasks
performed.

That is, we are specifically looking to:

- gain an understanding of Unix operating systems from a
  programmer's perspective

- gain programming experience; systems programming
  experience in particular

Programming on the systems level is somewhat different
from programming e.g. on the kernel level, from
programming in embedded environments, or from
programming mobile apps or databases.  We will be
_using_ the Unix environment as well as understanding
how it is implemented, how we can write tools for and
within the Unix environment.

In so doing, we will further

- gain a deeper understanding of a number of
  fundamental OS concepts.

Many of you will already have some familiarity with
these concepts, but I believe that all of you will
find our revisiting these concepts in this class will
strengthen your understanding and deepen your
knowledge.

---

Ok, great, learning all these things sounds awesome.
But _why_ are we doing this?  Well, of course _you_
are doing this so that you get a hopefully good grade
and are able to graduate, but I do naively hope that
we have additional goals as we follow this class:

For starters, understanding the Unix family of
operating systems gives you a better understanding of
other computer operating systems.

The systems level experience we gain here will make us
better, more advanced users of the system, and will
let us better understand the limitations of _all_
programs or applications we encounter.

Next, as mentioned earlier, we are programming in C.
Nowadays, C is often considered a "low level"
programming language -- something we'll get back to in
our next segment -- and there are many problems being
called out in using a language like C for modern
programming tasks.

However, understanding how C works, and what these
limitations are will help us better understand a
number of general programming and OS concepts, again
reinforcing some previous lessons and hopefully
helping you gain new insights as well.

Lastly, C is far from obsolete -- in fact, it remains
ubiquituous.  As we look at the different APIs and
interfaces of the standard libraries, we will find
that many if not most of the higher level programming
languages eventually fall back onto exactly these
standard libraries.  From a systems perspective, C
remains the de-facto standard and understanding how to
write C in the Unix environment will make you a better
programmer all around: a better python programmer, a
better Go programmer, a better perl or rust or even
javascript programmer.

---

Alright - now we know _what_ we're doing as well as
_why_ we're doing it, so let's take a look at _how_
we're going to do it.

As we will discuss in our next segment, the history of
the Unix family of operating systems is long and
complex, and different flavors have emerged over time.
For this class, we will need a single reference
platform to ensure that all students are working in
the same environment and I can grade your work on a
platform where we do not end up with a discussion
about how your code works just fine on your laptop,
but not on mine, or how your version of the hottest
linux distribution of the month has certain libraries,
but last month's variant does not, and now your code
explodes when I run it.

For this reasoņ, we are going to use the NetBSD
operating system as our reference platform.  Of course
you can develop and run your code on e.g., your macOS
system or your Linux VPS, but at the end of the day
your code is expected to compile and run on a NetBSD
9.0 system, which is where I will test and grade it.

There are many different ways for you to get access to
a NetBSD system - to make it easy for you, I've put
together step-by-step instructions on how to install
it in a VirtualBox VM, which you can see at the link
shown here.

This is the environment I will be using throughout
this class, and all code and terminal examples or
snippets are, unless explicitly noted, from a NetBSD
9.0 VM.

It is in your interest to make sure you have your
reference instance set up as early as possible,
preferably before our first class.

---

The next thing we note about programming is that it's
useful to be able to _read_ code.  In fact, reading
code is a critical skill not always stressed enough
when it comes to programming or computer science
education.

In this class, you should be in the habit of reading a
lot of code.  Fortunately for us, many of the Unix
flavors that are popular these days are Open Source
and we can easily browse their source code.

The NetBSD operating system is an open source OS as
well, and I recommend that you fetch and extract the
source code as shown on the screen here and make
yourself familiar with the code base.

Poke around the source tree, find the utilities we
mentioned earlier that you might understand how they
are implemented, then look at the code.

Another interesting thing to do is to compare how
different systems have implemented the same tools.
Consider that all the Unix systems come with a bunch
of tools that are more or less the same or at least
very similar across them -- do they share code?  Do
they implement the same logic?

See the recommended exercise linked to at the bottom
of this slide and make yourself familiar with
different code bases.

---

Now obviously reading code is only one part; the much
more obvious part is that in this class we will also
be _writing_ a whole lot of code, and I'm going to be
very, very pedantic about the quality of your code.

Code is communication.  Code needs to be easy to read
not just for the author right now, but for others as
well.

The reason for this is that you will always spend a
disproportionally bigger amount of time _reading_
code, debugging code than actually writing code.  When
you work on a code base with others or when you are
debugging a tool that somebody else wrote it's
critical that you can quickly dive right in and are
not confused by the author's specific style
preferences.

And writing legible, clear code is something that can
only be honed with practice.

So for every assignment and all the code you write in
this class, let's make sure that it is:

bullet points


We will discuss coding style and best practices
throughout the semester, but please do begin by
following the coding style linked on this slide as
well as from the course website.

---

Alright, so now on to more practical things.  Since
this is a university class, and you're paying a lot of
money in tuition, I will have to give you a grade at
the end of the semester.

Trust me, I wish I didn't have to.  But, you know, it
is what it is.  So here's how we're going to do this.

Even though this class is online, we are -- hopefully,
anyway -- going to have interactive exchanges,
sometimes synchronously via Zoom, sometimes
asynchronously on the mailing list, sometimes
semi-synchronously on the class Slack channel.  Your
participation here matters.  I'm looking for you to
speak up, to contribute, to ask questions, to follow
up on the lectures and all around to be mentally
present.

(This is a nice change from our in-class interactions,
where students generally are physically present, but
often not mentally; so maybe in this version of the
class we'll strike a reasonable equilibrium?)

Anyway, so class participation and your preparation
for each week in the form of course notes, which we'll
discuss in more detail in a minute, will make up 50
points.

There will be two smaller programming assignments,
maybe something like a two hundred lines of code or so
each.  Then there will be a more sizeable midterm
project, which we'll assign after the second week.
That will likely be several hundred lines of code,
maybe up to two thousand or so.

We'll then have a larger project that will be done in
teams of two or three people, and finally another
individual project towards the end of the semester.

All of these points should add up to 500 total points,
with letter grades being given out as explained on the
course website.

---

As mentioned, your course participation will in part
be evaluated based on the course notes you take.  This
is something that I've found to be useful to help
students come to class prepared, to help guide them
through the semester.

Here's how we will do this:

- read slide

The goal is for you to have a way to review your
progress throughout the semester.  Something that
might not have made much sense in the second or third
week may become clearer towards the end of the
semester.

Use these notes to guide you to what questions to ask
on the mailing list, what to seek clarification on,
and what to share with your class mates.

At the end of the semester, I will review the notes
to gauge your progress myself; the more detailed your
notes are, the easier it will be for me to give you
credit here.

---

The assignments will be posted to the class mailing
list and announced in the video lecture, but it is
your responsibiilty to note the due date and submit
your code on time.

I understand that especially at this time many people
have different obligations and anything may come up
that may derail your plans.  If that happens, please
come to me right away -- I'm ok with granting an
extension if circumstances require it, but I cannot
grant extensions simply for poor time management or
planning.

The assignments are given with sufficient time to
complete them, but in my experience students often
times start much too late.  You will not be able to
complete the assignments in a rushed manner in the
last minute or even within the last 24 hours before
they are due.

Please do not delay starting to work on the
assignments, as often times unexpected problems arise
and clarifications are necessary -- the sooner you
discover these issues, the better for you!

Give then current circumstances and trying to adopt
the new online-only syllabus, I'm also changing
another important part of this class: while there will
not be any make-up assignments or extra-credit work, I
will allow you to resubmit your code after you have
received your grade to correct any major problems.

This option will be available if the work you
submitted did not receive an A.  In that case, you may
take my comments and resubmit your improved code a
week later to attempt to bump up your grade.

Finally, I'm sad to have to explicitly point out that
you are responsible for all your work yourself.  Every
semester I have at least one student who will hand in
code that they did not write themselves -- this
constitutes plagiarism and possibly copyright
violations and will yield a failing grade.

Please note that even though the code for the Unix
systems we are using is publicly available and is
licensed as Open Source code, you may still _not_ take
that code and submit as your own for the assignments
in this class.

The same holds for smaller code segments and snippets:
if you run into a problem, search the internet and
follow the first Google result to the Stackoverflow
answer and then copy that code snippet into your
assignment, then that may also constitute plagiarism;
at a minimum, you need to identify to me in your code
which parts you did not write yourself and copied from
the internet.

I know very well that in that so-called "real world"
out there people search for and copy code from
Stackoverflow all the time, but it is critical for
Computer Science students to learn to properly cite
their sources.

The programming assignments given here are not like
the problems you're solving in that mystical "real
world" -- they are not an objective for you to
produce, but an opportunity for you to learn
something.  By blindly copying code from the internet
and glueing together something that perhaps even works
but that you did not write yourself you are robbing
yourself of the opportunity to really understand the
problem, to learn.

The best way to avoid any problems here is for you to
actually sit down and write all code you hand in
yourself.  And if you run into problems, if you have
questions about how to best do something, please reach
out on our class mailing list, where I encourage all
of you to share code segments and to discuss the best
approach to any given issue.

---

Ok, with all the formalities out of the way, let's
take a look at our syllabus:

We will by and large follow the outline of the course
book, although we will also throw in a lecture on
using the Unix programming environment in an efficient
manner.  Other than that, I hope that you will find a
certain progression in the topics we'll cover:

We will begin with local file I/O and file systems,
take a look at process relationships, then move on to
interprocess communications and network programming
before we round out our understanding of the system
with a number of mixed, advanced topics.

The order of the lectures may be subject to change,
based on how much time I find to put together the
online lectures and based on our discussions in class.

--

Finally, here are the primary course resources that
you should have bookmarked.

The most important link is the course website, shown
here.  This website is linked to from the Stevens
Canvas shell and remains authoritative for all
information about the class.

There is no other information in the Stevens Canvas
shell, so please do make sure to refer to the course
website for all materials.

The second most important part is the course mailing
list, which will be our primary means of
communication.  I have subscribed all students who are
currently enrolled in the class; if you are not
subscribed, please do subscribe yourself, using your
stevens.edu email address.  (I cannot and will not
accept other addresses.)

The mailing list is a discussion list, not an
announcements-only list: I will send announcements
there, but I expect you to participate in discussions
on the list.  If you have a question or seek
clarification about anything, please send a mail to
the mailing list.  If you send it to me in private,
chances are that I will reply saying "please send your
question to the class mailing list", so save yourself
that roundtrip.  The only time you should email me
off-list is if you are refering to your grades or any
other personal circumstances; any generic questions
should go to the list.

The reason for this is that it is quite likely that if
_you_ have a question, that the other students would
also benefit from the answer or clarification.  Please
don't be shy!

Please also do not rely on me to respond to any
questions you see on the class mailing list: if you
know the answer, or you think you do, please reply on
the mailing list.  If you come across an interesting
link relevant to the class in general or a specific
topic in particular, please share it!  I'm looking for
actual interactions on the list.


I've also set up a Slack channel for this class, and
have invited all registered students to join.  If you
have not received an invite, please email me and I
will add you.

The Slack channel is intended to let us discuss
anything semi-synchronously.  You may share links,
post questions, or engage in code analysis or
comparison at any time.  However, while the mailing
list is mandatory reading, the Slack channel is
optional for you to join.  That is, any announcements
of importance are sent to the mailing list, but I hope
that we can enjoy chatting on Slack as time permits.

I myself will peek in on the Slack channel every so
ofteņ, but you shouldn't expect an immediate response
from me.

Finally, the last link goes to the course youtube
channel, where I will upload video lectures like this
as I finish them.

---

Ok, phew, we're coming to the end of the first segment
of week 1.  Let's quickly recap what homework you have
in order to get the most our of this class.  This is,
in effect, the prep work you should do for the course
notes every week, and is something that I'd expect any
good students to already be in the habit of:

read slides

Note that the course website has a number of
recommended exercises that are not graded assignments.
That is, I put together a few problems or tasks that I
believe will help you better understand the topic for
the given week, and I very much recommend that you use
them as a self-guided study tool.

You will also note that my lecture slides include a
lot of code snippets.  Even in the video lecture,
these may fly by quickly, so I recommend that after
you have viewed the lecture you take some time to run
the commands and examples we used.  This will help you
understand what we're trying to do or may lead to
questions you might have.

--

For this week specifically, your homework is basically
to get fully set up for this class, to bookmark all
the resources, to initialize your course notes, and to
get your NetBSD reference platform VM set up.

If you run into problems, please send a mail to the
mailing list!

--

Alright - this concludes our first video segment for
week 1 of the Fall 2020 semester of CS631 Advanced
Programming in the UNIX Environment!  I hope you were
able to pay attention and find that this video lecture
is helpful.

The slides accompanying this video are of course
available from the course website as well.

In our next segment, we'll cover the UNIX history and
take a look at some of the basics of the unix
programming environment and important features of the
C programming language, which, as you know, can be a
bit fickle.

But more on that in our next segment...

Thanks for watching, and until the next time - cheers!
