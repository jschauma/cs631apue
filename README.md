CS631APUE - Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment
========================================================

In this repository you can find the files I use for my class "[CS631 -
Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment]
(http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~jschauma/631/)", which is currently offered at
[Stevens Institute of Technology](http://www.cs.stevens.edu/).

Contents
--------

For the most part, you will find the LaTeX files I use to create the
slides for my lectures.  (I use
[xdvipresent](http://clip.dia.fi.upm.es/Software/xdvipresent_html/xdvipresent_2.html)
to create the slides.)

Homework assignments etc, are generally kept on the course website and are
usually changing, so I may not necessarily include them here.

Sometimes a given lecture's directory may include additional notes or
scripts.

The organization of this directory tree is by lecture, and I will
commit/update the contents throughout the Fall 2012 semester as we go
along.

The syllabus of the class and all materials in here (with the exception of
various graphics or images used as illustration in the slides) were
created by Jan Schaumann &lt;jschauma@netmeister.org&gt; based on the
well-known book by W. Richard Stevens; all copyright for the course
materials is retained.  You are free to use the materials in any manner
you wish so long as you give credit for it.  Pointing people to this
repository or the [course website](http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~jschauma/631/)
is sufficient and appreciated.  Likewise, you are encouraged to contact me with any
questions, suggestions, corrections, concerns or comments relating to this
content.

Non-copyright / licensed materials
----------------------------------

I occasionally use a few random images in my slides.  These are images
found on the internet, sometimes even related to the topic at hand.  I'm
not a copyright expert, but I believe that my use of the images in my
class constitutes fair use:

<blockquote>
``<em>[...] the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by
reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by
that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,
teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or
research, is not an infringement of copyright.</em>''
</blockquote>

On the other hand, re-distribution of the materials may very well not be
considered "fair use".  I'm including the graphics and images I use in
this repository so as to make it easy for anybody else to use them for
"fair use" purposes only, and I'm explicitly noting them to <em>not</em>
be under my copyright nor licensed as my materials are.

If you are the owner of such material and would like to get attribution,
or have me remove it, please just <a
href="mailto:jschauma@netmeister.org">let me know</a>.


All code examples included here are trivial, but they may be derived from
the code samples available at http://www.apuebook.com/sourcecode.html; I
have contacted the author to clarify the copyright and licensing on the
source code.  Unless explicitly noted elsewhere, you may assume that the
files I upload to GitHub are so trivial as to not be copyrightable.
